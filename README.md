# Random-Password-Generator
This week, we were assigned with creating a random password generator. With cybersecurity becoming more and more important, and as individuals begin to leave more personal and confidential information on the web, this application has definite real world application! 
JavaScript was used to fill in the code for the generator. Functions, loops, confirms, prompts and alerts were used to build the generator.
